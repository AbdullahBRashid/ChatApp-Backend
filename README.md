# <h1 style="text-align: center">Backend for the old-pandachat-app</h1>

This is a small little backend for the [ChatApp-Old](https://github.com/AbdullahBRashid/ChatApp-Old) Repo.


This is not in anyway secure or privacy focused. Just a small project I made in a few days. Feel free to use it in anyway you would like.

## Usage

Clone the repo or download the zip.
Open the directory in your terminal.
This server is **not secure** for production usage.

    npm init -y
    npm install
    node app.js
